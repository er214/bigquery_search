# bigquery_search
This is a repo of code to accompany [this blog post](https://www.efficientdatagroup.com/blog/natural-language-search-in-google-bigquery) about creating natural language search functionality in Google BigQuery.

There are two notebooks, which can be run in Colab. The first imports Glove vectors to a table in BigQuery.

The second then includes examples of SQL code to run similarity queries.
